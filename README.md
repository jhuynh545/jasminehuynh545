I am a data science graduate from TripleTen Tech. Throughout my time with TripleTen, I completed 15 projects. I also joined a code jam competition November 2024. My team got first place in the competition and won the audience award. 

My skills include Python, data visualization, EDA, SDA, SQL, and machine learning. I have worked with Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code.

I am always looking to grow and learn as much as I can. You can reach me at my email jasminehuynh1@gmail.com.
